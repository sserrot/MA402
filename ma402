= Quick Look at Mainstream Renewables Energies

== Introduction

This database shows the five types of renewable energy and their practical uses in the modern world. 

== Changes to the data
Upon first inspection of the database, we saw that there were several changes that needed to be made to make the database more intuitive and
user friendly. We also added several connections and additional nodes to expand the database. Below is a list of the major changes we have made:
-Improved grammar and language
-Changed target node to transform
-Introduced new relationships between nodes
-Added new nodes and integrated them into the database
-Added new queries

== Graph

== Types of Nodes
There are five types in this database. These types are:
ENERGY: Energy describes a type of renewable energy. In these nodes, there is Solar Energy, Wind Power, Hydropower, Geothermal Energy, and Biofuel.
APPLICATION: Application describes the real world use of each type of renewable energy. In these nodes, there is Domestic Applications, Windmills, 
Propel Ships, Agriculture, Urban Planning, Alternative Transports, HVAC Systems, Conventional Hydroelectricity, Run-of-the-River Hydroelectricity, 
and Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity. 
FUEL: Fuel describes types of biofuel. In these nodes, there is Bioalchohols, Biodiesel, Vegetable Oil Fuel, and Syngas. 
TRANSFORM: Transform describes different ways that the renewable sources of energy can be transformed. In these nodes, there is Electricity Production,
Fuel Production, Ventilation, Cooling, and Heating. 
FORM: Form describes different forms of renewable energy. In these nodes, there is Conventional Hydroelectricity, Run-of-the-River Hydroelectricity,
Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity, Passive Solar, and Active Solar. 

== Relationships
There are two types of relationships in this database. These types are: 
USED_FOR: This relationship is between two nodes where one node is used as an element of the second node. 
AS: Further defines a node into subcategories.
TYPE: The different forms that a renewable energy can take on.

== Relationships between Nodes
Each node is connected to a different node by one of the relationships described above. 
-Energy nodes are connected to application nodes with the USED_FOR relationship.
-Energy nodes are connected to transform nodes with the USED_FOR relationship.
-Transform nodes are connected to application nodes with the USED_FOR relationship. 
-Form nodes are connected to energy nodes with the TYPE relationship. 
-Application nodes are connected to transform nodes with the AS relationship. 
-Transform nodes are connected to fuel nodes with the AS relationship.


== Queries

=== Names of Mainstream Renewables Energies
This query lists all of the energy nodes found in this database. These are the most common renewable energy sources used in the world.

[source, cypher]
----
match (n:Energy) return distinct n.name as renewableEnergy;
----

MATCH ()-[r:USED_FOR]->() RETURN r LIMIT 25

This query returns all the relationships that represent what each renewable energy is used for.

MATCH ()-[r:TYPE]->() RETURN r LIMIT 25

This query returns the different types of Solar, Wind, and Hydro power that can be produced.

//table

==Sources of electricity
This query shows what types of renewable energies produce electricity. 
match (n:Transform)-[*1..2]-(e:Energy) return distinct e.name as energy, collect(e.name) as renewablesEnergies;


=== Transformations
Often renewable energies have to be transformed to be useful. This table shows the transformations that we have covered in this database. 

[source, cypher]
----
match (n:Energy)-[*1..2]-(t:Transform) return distinct t.name as transform, collect(n.name) as renewablesEnergies;
----

//table

== Common Uses

To be useful, renewable energy must have applications in the modern world. This table shows what applications each energy type has.

== Takeaways from this database
Alternative energies have been increasing in popularity in recent decades due to decreasing fossil fuel supplies and increasing political tension between nations.
As fossil fuels become more scarce, we will need to seek another source of energy to fulfill our day-to-day energy needs. This database allows users to see some of the different real world applications of the different forms of renewable energies.
By putting all of this information into one database the user can quickly see all of the useful applications and forms of alternative energy not only on a nation-wide scale but also on a personal level. If the user wishes reduce their reliability on fossil fuels,
they can quickly search the database for the application they want to perform and see which alternative energies they can use to accomplish their goals.
